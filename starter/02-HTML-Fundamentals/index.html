				All modern websites and web applications are built using three
				<em>fundamental</em> technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages
				of the web.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you
				too should learn it.
			</p>

			<h3>What is HTML?</h3>
			<p>
				HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup
				<strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup language that web developers use to
				structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).
			</p>
			<p>
				HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs,
				links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML
				code as websites.
			</p>
			<p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
			<!-- ol: Ordered list -->
			<ol>
				<!-- li: List item -->
				<li>The opening tag</li>
				<li>The closing tag</li>
				<li>The actual element</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				You can learn more at the
				<!-- a: anchor (ie. hyperlink) to somewhere within or outside the page  -->
				<!-- [attri] target: Allow the link to be open in another tab -->
				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank"
					>MDN Web Docs</a
				>.
			</p>

			<h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
			<p>
				There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here
				are 5 of them:
			</p>
			<!-- ul: Unordered list -->
			<ul>
				<li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
				<li>
					To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or
					Wix
				</li>
				<li>To build web applications</li>
				<li>To impress friends</li>
				<li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
